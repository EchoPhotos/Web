      <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will
        automatically apply to you ‚Äì you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the app. You‚Äôre not
        allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
        our trademarks in any way. You‚Äôre not allowed to attempt to
        extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn‚Äôt try
        to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
        versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
        database rights and other intellectual property rights related
        to it, still belong to Echo Labs AG.
      </p>
      <p>
        Echo Labs AG is committed to ensuring that the app is
        as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
        reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
        its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
        charge you for the app or its services without making it very
        clear to you exactly what you‚Äôre paying for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Echo Photos app stores and processes personal data that
        you have provided to us, in order to provide our
        Service. It‚Äôs your responsibility to keep your phone and
        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
        official operating system of your device. It could make your
        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
        compromise your phone‚Äôs security features and it could mean
        that the Echo Photos app won‚Äôt work properly or at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that
        Echo Labs AG will not take responsibility for. Certain
        functions of the app will require the app to have an active
        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
        by your mobile network provider, but Echo Labs AG
        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
        functionality if you don‚Äôt have access to Wi-Fi, and you don‚Äôt
        have any of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you‚Äôre using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
        should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
        other third party charges. In using the app, you‚Äôre accepting
        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you‚Äôre
        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
        received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, Echo Labs AG cannot always take
        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
        make sure that your device stays charged ‚Äì if it runs out of
        battery and you can‚Äôt turn it on to avail the Service,
        Echo Labs AG cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to Echo Labs AG‚Äôs responsibility for your
        use of the app, when you‚Äôre using the app, it‚Äôs important to
        bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
        to you. Echo Labs AG accepts no liability for any
        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
        relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
        currently available on Android &amp; iOS ‚Äì the requirements for
        both systems(and for any additional systems we
        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
        and you‚Äôll need to download the updates if you want to keep
        using the app. Echo Labs AG does not promise that it
        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
        and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
        (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
        from your device.
      </p>
