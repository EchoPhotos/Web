## Dev Setup

1. `pnpm i` or `npm i`

2. `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`


## Deploy
Make sure to copy `next-i18mext.config.js` to `/public` when changed as firebase hosting ignores it else.


## Notes
`next/swc-darwin-arm64` as a `devDependency` is just a workaround for a current dependency bug.
